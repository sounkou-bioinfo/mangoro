}
\arguments{
\item{src}{Path to the Go source file}

\item{out}{Path to the output binary}

\item{gomaxprocs}{Number of threads for Go build (sets GOMAXPROCS env variable)}

\item{gocache}{Path to Go build cache directory. If NULL (default), uses a
temporary directory to comply with CRAN policy. Set to NA to use the default
Go cache location.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to pass to Go build}
}
\value{
Path to the compiled binary

\description{
Compiles a Go source file using the vendored dependencies from the mangoro package.

To comply with CRAN policy, this function temporarily redirects several environment
variables to prevent Go from writing to user directories:
\itemize{
\item \code{HOME} is set to a temporary directory because Go's telemetry system
(introduced in Go 1.23+) writes data to \code{~/.config/go/telemetry}
using \code{os.UserConfigDir()}, which cannot be disabled via environment
variables alone.
\item \code{GOCACHE} is set to a temporary directory to prevent build cache
writes to \code{~/.cache/go-build}.
\item \code{GOENV} is set to a temporary file to prevent config writes to
\code{~/.config/go/env}.
}
All environment variables are restored and temporary directories cleaned up
after the build completes.
